This directory contains the files needed to train the CNN and RNN. Below is a description of everything in this directory.

lsst_mocks_single/: This directory contains simulations of images of the LSST best single epoch images. This is divided into two subdirs:

	/lensed_outputs/: where lensed images are saved
	/unlensed_outputs/: where unlensed images are saved

Each of these subdirs includes a /0/ subdirectory, which includes our training set.

I was only able to upload 100 of each type of image due to size constraints in the repo. Note that each image is a -tar.gz file. To unzip, do the following:
	' find . -type f -exec gunzip {} + ' 
in your terminal.

If you'd like access to the full suite of simulated images, proceed to the following link: 
	' http://portal.nersc.gov/project/hacc/nanli/lsst_sl_mocks/ '
and download ' lsst_sl_mocks/tar '

A warning that it takes some non-trivial time to download the FITS images into a working .py notebook, depending on the number of images that you download.
