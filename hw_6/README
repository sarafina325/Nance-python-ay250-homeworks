Please run the attached Python notebook for image validation / classification
You may need to run the entire notebook to train your random forest algorithm.

We got 8% accuracy when running this, which wasn't great--but for image classification using a random forest algorithm,
that's not super surprising. 

Using deep learning/a CNN will likely yield much better results.
